# Fullscreen.js
Fullscreen mode for web browsers

### JSLint
To test Fullscreen.js, use `jslint --browser --sloppy fullscreen.js`.

### Usage
Fullscreen.js should be pretty self-explanatory from the function comments; all
you have to do to include it in your project is:

`<script src="fullscreen.js"></script>`

from some HTML file, in the `<head>` tag, before you use any of the library's
functions.
